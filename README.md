# Topics in Theoretical Computer Science (CS-455) – EPFL / NYU

This repository contains my **graded homework solutions** for the course **CS-455: Topics in Theoretical Computer Science** at **EPFL**, taught jointly with **NYU**.  
The course was given by **Prof. Ola Svensson** and **Prof. Michael Kapralov** (EPFL), in collaboration with **Prof. Anupam Gupta** (NYU).

## 📘 Course Description

The course explored the **power of randomness in algorithm design**, showing how probabilistic techniques can lead to elegant and efficient solutions to complex computational problems. It covered both foundational principles and modern applications, with examples drawn from **graph algorithms**, **data structures**, **learning theory**, and **optimization**.  

Key topics included **graph sparsification**, **randomized rounding**, **dimension reduction**, **Chernoff bounds**, **martingale inequalities**, and **the Lovász Local Lemma**. The course also touched on applications such as **approximate counting**, **differential privacy**, **learning from samples**, and **randomized methods in geometry and communication complexity**.  

The EPFL offering was conducted in collaboration with the **Randomized Algorithms** course at **NYU**, running in parallel across both institutions.

## ✍️ Authorship and Collaboration

The **problem statements** in these assignments were created by the **course instructors** and teaching staff.  
The **solutions** presented here were collaboratively written by **Zachary Doll** and **Simon Barras**, a fellow EPFL student.  

All documents were written and compiled using **LaTeX**.
