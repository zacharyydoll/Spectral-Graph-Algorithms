\section{Problem 1 (Lonely Vertices)}
Consider the Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graph
$G(n,p)$ and suppose $\epsilon > 0$ is some constant. Show that:
\begin{alphenum}
    \item if $p \geq \frac{(1+\epsilon)\ln n}{n-1}$ then the graph has at no
    isolated vertices with probability $1-o(1)$.
    \item if $p \leq \frac{(1-\epsilon)\ln n}{n-1}$ then the graph has at
    least one isolated vertex with probability $1-o(1)$.
\end{alphenum}

\section{Problem 2 (Cutting it Fine)}
Given a connected undirected (and unweighted,
for simplicity) $n$-vertex graph $G$, a $k$-cut is a paritition of
the vertex set into $k$ non-empty parts $S_1, S_2, \ldots, S_k$. The
size of the $k$-cut is the number of edges that cross between
distinct parts in this partition. Consider the following algorithm:
\begin{itemize}
    \item (Phase 1) As long as the number of vertices in $G$ is more
          than $2k-2$, pick a random edge and contract it.
    \item (Phase 2) Now we have a graph on $2k-2$ vertices. For each of
          these vertices, choose a random label from
          $\{L_1,L_2,\ldots, L_k\}$, contract vertices with the same label,
          and output the resulting cut.
\end{itemize}
Show the following:
\begin{alphenum}
    \item If the min $k$-cut size is $\lambda$, then
    $\lambda \leq 2(k-1)\frac{m}{n}$.
    \item Any fixed min $k$-cut survives the first phase with
    probability at least $1/{n \choose {2(k-1)}}$.
    \item Conditioned on surviving the first phase, it is output in the
    second phase with probability at least
    $\frac{k!}{k^k}\cdot \frac{1}{k^{k-2}}$.
\end{alphenum}
Hence, this gives an $\approx n^{2(k-1)}$-time algorithm for the
$k$-cut problem.

\section{Problem 3 (Cyclic Changes)}
An $\ell$-cycle in a graph is a cycle with \emph{at
    most} $\ell$ nodes. In this problem, we want to show there exist
graphs with many edges, and no \emph{short} cycles. It is easy to
construct such graphs with $\Omega(n)$ edges---in fact, a tree has
$n-1$ edges and no cycles at all!  We want slightly denser graphs
with no $\ell$-cycles for any constant $\ell$.
\begin{alphenum}
    \item Consider the graph $G(n, p)$ for some $p \in [0,1]$. Calculate
    the probability that some sequence of $\ell$ vertices is a cycle,
    and hence calculate the expected number of $\ell$-cycles.

    \item (Do not submit.) Note that setting $p \approx 1/n$ means the
    expected number of $\ell$-cycles is $o(1)$, but the expected
    number of edges is $O(n)$---which is not very interesting!

    \item Now consider the following two part algorithm: (i) first pick
    $G \sim G(n,p)$, and then (ii) for each $\ell$-cycle in $G$,
    delete an arbitrary edge on it. By construction this graph has no
    $\ell$-cycles. Show that setting $p = n^{\frac{2 - \ell}{\ell-1}}$
    ensures that the expected number of edges in the resulting graph
    is $m := \Theta(n^{1 + \frac{1}{\ell-1}})$. Hence, infer that there exist
    graphs with $m = \omega(n)$ edges and no $\ell$-cycles.
\end{alphenum}

\section{Problem 4 (Random 3-SAT)}
 (Taken from Johan H\aa stad's course ``Theoreticians toolkit''
 at KTH.) Constructing a random 3-SAT formula with n variables and
$m = \lceil dn \rceil$ (remember that $\lceil x \rceil$ is the
smallest integer larger than x) clauses is done in the following
way. Randomly take three different variables (all triples being
equally likely). With uniform probability choose one of the eight
ways to negate these variables and make them into a clause. Repeat
with independent randomness until you have $m$ clauses.

\begin{alphenum}
    \item For what value of $d$ is the expected number of satisfying
    assignments $\Theta(1)$?  Call this value $d_0$.

    \item Prove that the formula is likely (probability $1-o(1)$) to be
    unsatisfiable for any constant $d$ such that $d > d_0$.
    \item \textbf{(Extra Credit.)} Prove that the formula remains at least somewhat likely to be
    unsatisfiable also in the case when $d$ is slightly smaller than
    $d_0$. The difficulty of this problem is very much dependent on
    what we mean by ``somewhat likely'' and ``slightly smaller''. The
    exact formulation to prove to get a full score on this problem is
    that there is some constant $d_1 < d_0$ such that for $d = d_1$
    the probability that the corresponding random formula is
    satisfiable is at most $1/2$. The size of $d_0 - d_1$ does not
    matter for your score on the problem and the main property of a
    solution to aim for is a mathematically correct argument.
    \emph{Hint:} A satisfiable formula that does not depend on all its
    variables has many satisfying assignments.

    % As a curiosity we may note that the value of $d$ such that such
    % a formula has probability around $1/2$ of being satisfiable is
    % not known but conjectured to be around $4.2$.
\end{alphenum}
